# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to
[this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db/hub/advice-generator-app-OqYfufdB3V)
challenge. To make the short story, this webpage makes an HTTP request to
[advice slip api](https://api.adviceslip.com/) to get a random advice every time
the page loads or the dice button is pressed.

## What it does?

Well, as explained above, just shows random advices that can be useful for u :D.
As an extra I added a small animation to the dice button when it's clicked and
also disables it until the GET request has finished.
